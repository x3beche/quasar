# AX45-S
Is a crypto system that uses only its own unique algorithms that do not use any ready-made system that is extremely simple to use. Is open to changes and innovations. You can make new additions to the algorithms. To crack this algorithm, you need to make 30 factorial combinations, if you try it will take billions of years. Statistically it is impossible to break.
